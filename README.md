# Ulam Spiral

A simulation of the ulam spiral. A spiral that is generated through putting the points that represent a prime number in a spiral structure. The start is 1 in the middle, and we continue to the right, up, left, then down and repeat.

# Compiling the project:

You need to either install SFML on your machine or define include and lib directory in the compilation in the makefile.

This was created on Linux Mint with SFML 2.6 and C++17. However, this code will definitely run on older versions of C++ and SFML.
